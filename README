Protracer is a simple raytracer originally written in 1999 as a university
course project.
Please beware that, despite the name, there is nothing especially professional
about Protracer. The name is meant to be a pun on the Protracker music tracker
application.

Protracer is now released under the GNU General Public License.

Protracer currently supports a very limited subset of the POV-Ray file format.

To build Protracer run "make" in the source directory.
There is currently no install system, but Autotools support is planned.

The program expects an input on stdin. Thus to run issue a command like:

./tracer <options> output.ppm < input.pov

Where input.pov is the input scene description and output.ppm is the output in
PPM format (this is the only possible output format right now).

The command line syntax is planned to be santitised in a later release.
